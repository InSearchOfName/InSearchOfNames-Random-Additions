# InSearchOfNames: Random Additions

This project is a fun side project focused on generating and experimenting with random thingsâ€”names, concepts, and more. The main goal is to explore randomness and creativity in code, without strict rules or a specific end goal.

Feel free to browse or use any part of this project for your own experiments!
