# InSearchOfNames: Random Additions

This project is a fun side project focused on generating and experimenting with random things, concepts, and more—within the context of a Minecraft plugin. The main goal is to explore randomness and creativity in code, without strict rules or a specific end goal.

The primary command for this plugin is `/menu`, which opens the main interface for interacting with its features.

Feel free to browse or use any part of this project for your own experiments!
It's simply a collection of random things I want to code—nothing more, nothing less.
